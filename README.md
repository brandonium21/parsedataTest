# parsedataTest

This is the api data parse project, I would have done more to make it look oo dbut astetics take a while whith out a UI designer.
So I opted with the practicle view. 

I used Flask to create the app because its a ery rapid development framework. And Its Python who doesn't like Python?

## Install dependancies
RUN `pip install Flask`
RUN `pip install requests`

## Run program
RUN `FLASK_APP=main.py flask run`

Thanks for the oppertunity.
